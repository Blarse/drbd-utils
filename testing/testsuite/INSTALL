==================
== REQUIREMENTS ==
==================


Perl 5.6 (or higher)
        Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, 
        extracting information from those text files, and printing reports 
        based on that information.  
        Perl is needed, because Agents and Testsuite files are written as 
        Perl scripts.


Time::HiRes
        This mdoule implements an interface to high resolution time and timers
        like "usleep".

        perl -MCPAN -e shell
        install Time::HiRes


Time::Local
        This module implements the inverse of the built-in perl functions local-
        time and gmtime. It is used to convert a timestamp to UTC format.

        perl -MCPAN -e shell
        install Time::Local


IO::Socket
        Provides an object interface to create and use sockets.

        perl -MCPAN -e shell
        install IO::Socket


=============
== INSTALL ==
=============


1.) Unpack the testsuite.tar.gz to any directory.

      $ tar -xzvf testsuite.tar.gz

== on both drbd nodes ==

2a.) Edit agent.conf according to your system configuration:
      - interface on which drbd is connected
      - ip address on which the Agent is connected
      - port on which the Agent is listening
      - drbd resource which should be used
      - mountpoint of the drbd device
      - drbd device which shoud be used

     Example given in agent.conf

3a.) Start agent.pl on each Agent. If you want the Agent to run in realtime
     (priority scheduling), you need root privileges.

      $ ./agent.pl


== on the Testsuite client ==

2b.) Edit testsuite.conf according to your system configuration:
      - Node configuration (address and port)
      - Seq_commands
      - Default values (timeout, latency, timeserver)

     Example given in testsuite.conf


== testing procedure ==

4.) Now you are ready to start the Testsuite.

      $ ./testsuite.pl -v
