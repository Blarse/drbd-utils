uml-screen-debug
   starts an uml inside a screen session, and attaches gdb.
   All VCs, the console and the gdb are screen windows,
   so you can attach to them wherever you like, and you don't have your
   desktop cluttered with 9 xterms...

   Intended usage:
   xterm -fg white  -bg black    -geom 132x80 -e ./uml-screen-debug uml-1
   xterm -fg yellow -bg darkblue -geom 132x80 -e ./uml-screen-debug uml-2

uml_profile-USER@HOSTNAME
   configuration file for uml-screen-debug, so it knows what ubdX and
   network ips to configure.

= gdb helpers for uml =
uml-2.4.gdbinit
uml-2.6.gdbinit
   look into them to see what they are good for.
