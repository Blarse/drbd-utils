				 DRBD

Unfortunately my time does not allow me to maintain this README besides
the software. 

Please refer to the web pages at
http://www.drbd.org/
to find maintained information.

Reference documentation is included in the documentation directory.
Please have a look at INSTALL or INSTALL.html, too.
BTW, if there is no INSTALL.html, say "make INSTALL.html" :)


DEBUGING:

In case you experience kernel crashes when using DRBD, please
define "DBG_ALL_SYMBOLS" in drbd_config.h, and recompile DRBD.

Run the oops through ksymoops and send it to the DRBD mailinglist.
If you don't know what ksymoops is, read
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt

BUILD RPMS:

It should be enough to just say: make rpm.
If not, you probably need to add some packages,
or edit the drbd.spec(.in) file.

After make rpm there should be distributable rpms in dist/*/*/drbd-*.*.rpm

REDHAT USERS:

Have a look into drbd_config.h, and uncomment the RH-specific defines.

If you do not run a selfcompiled kernel, but the binary shipped
distro kernel, and after "make install" the drbd module ends up in
the wrong place (e.g. /lib/modules/2.4.20custom/, when you want it
in /lib/modules/2.4.20/), edit the top-level Makefile of your
kernel source tree and remove "custom" from the EXTRAVERSION.
Make sure you copied in the .config corresponding to the kernel you use.
Don't forget to "make dep" in /usr/src/linux, it sometimes helps, too.

(you could of course edit .kernelversion in the drbd directory,
 or copy by hand, too)
