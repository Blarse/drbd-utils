Please have a look at INSTALL or INSTALL.html, too.
BTW, if there is no INSTALL.html, say "make INSTALL.html" :)

DEBUGING:
---------

In case you experience kernel crashes when using DRBD, please
define "DBG_ALL_SYMBOLS" in drbd_config.h, and recompile DRBD.

Run the oops through ksymoops and send it to the DRBD mailinglist.
If you don't know what ksymoops is, read
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt

BUILD RPMS:
-----------

Read INSTALL.
