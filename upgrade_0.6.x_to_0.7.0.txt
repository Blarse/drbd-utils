DRBD upgrade instructions from 0.6.x to 0.7.0

* Since drbd-0.7.x is protocol incompatile to drbd-0.6.x you need
  to do a offline upgrade. I.e. no "rolling" upgrade possible.

  Make sure that the devices are in sync, make both sides secondary
  first and then stop DRBD on both nodes.

* In drbd-0.7.0 each DRBD resource needs 128MB of storage on
  some block device for its meta data. (With this /var/lib/drbd
  disappeared.)

  In order to do this upgrade you either need to

   A) shrink your filesystems on the DRBD devices by at least 128MB
   B) grow the backing_storage of the DRBD devices by at leas 128MB
   C) have one seperate block_device for all meta data

  A)
  ext2/ext3   resize2fs
  reiserfs    resize_reiserfs     
  xfs         xfsdump, xfsrestore ; xfs can only grow

  B)
  lvresize    in case you run DRBD on LVM
  (fdisk)     (Only do this if you know what you are doing.)

  C)
  The device needs to be n*128MB, where n is the number of 
  DRBD resources.

* Update you configurate file:
  - Change it to the new syntax.
  - Remove the disk-size parameter from you drbd.conf
  - Add the meta-disk settings
  - Remove tl-size
  - Change sync-min & sync-max to sync { rate }
  - Add the al-extents setting

* Start DRBD on both nodes

* Tune the al-extents setting to balance the number of updates
  to the metadata per minute (see cat /proc/drbd umber "al:") vs
  the expected resync time.
