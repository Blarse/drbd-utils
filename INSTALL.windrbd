To compile this under Cygwin (tested with Windows 7), do

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/usr --localstatedir=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/var --sysconfdir=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/etc --without-83support --without-84support --without-drbdmon --with-windrbd
make
make install

If you are not already running bash as Administrator user, run the last
command (make install) as Administrator, else make install will fail.
