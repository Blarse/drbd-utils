DRBD upgrade instructions from 0.7.0 to 0.7.1

With drbd-0.7.1 we have our own major number, and our own device
files. (=No longer misuse /dev/nbX)

* Start on the node, on which all devices are secondary.
* /etc/init.d/drbd stop
* Install drbd-0.7.1
* Run these commands as root:

sed -e "s/\/dev\/nb/\/dev\/drbd/" < /etc/drbd.conf > /etc/drbd.conf_new
mv /etc/drbd.conf /etc/drbd.conf_old ; mv /etc/drbd.conf_new /etc/drbd.conf
sed -e "s/\/dev\/nb/\/dev\/drbd/" < /etc/fstab > /etc/fstab_new
mv /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_old ; mv /etc/fstab_new /etc/fstab
for ((i=0;i<16;i++)); do mknod /dev/drbd$i b 147 $i; done

* /etc/init.d/drbd start
* migrate all services to the just upgraded node and 
  upgrade the other node.
